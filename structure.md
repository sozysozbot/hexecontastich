## Syllable

| structure  | example  |
|------------|----------|
| CV  | ˈʔiː**ɣə**kiˈnɑːse̞βiˈʔɑnte̞ɣo̞ˈniːsiː  |
| CVN | se̞ːˈsupe̞ɾiːʔɑː**ˈɣɑn**təso̞ˈɾiːʔə  |
| CVː | ɑːkəsi**ˈne̞ː**ɾəɣəˈʔɑːɾiːniːˈse̞ko̞ |
| CVh | **ˈde̞h**to̞nəɣiːˈɾɑse̞ʔɑːkɑːˈsuhte̞ |

## Onsets
`/p/`, `/β/`, `/m/`, `/t/`, `/ɾ/`, `/n/`, `/s/`, `/k/`, `/ɣ/` and `/ʔ/` can come as the initial consonant. No complex consonant clusters allowed.

## Vowels
`/i/`, `/e̞/`, `/ə/`, `/u/` and `/o̞/`. Each has a longer version, except that the longer counterpart of `/ə/` is `/ɑː/`. `/əN/` becomes `/ɑN/` except when the next syllable is accented.

`/u/` have merged to `/o/` in heavy syllables (that is, `/uN/`, `/uː/` and `/uh/`) except for the poems from the earliest time. Hence in 2020-10-11 we see both `sɑːmo̞ːˈʔindiko̞ˈʔɑssiɾiˈβo̞ndə` and `me̞ntiɾiˈnɑsse̞ɣe̞ʔɑːməko̞ˈnumbə` while we see no more of `/uN/` in the later poems. The merger of `/uː/` to `/o:/` has been particularly early, and even in earlier times `/uː/` occurred only in onomatopoeic `/buːbuː/` and `/nuːnuː/`.

## Exceptional syllables
There is a rare instance of an interjection known to be monosyllabic by metric but written as a three-syllable sequence `/ɣəh/ + /kə/ + /ɣi/`. It is usually interpreted that this sequence denoted `/hɑj/`.

## Assimilation

|      |    N   |    h   |
| ---- |--------|--------|
| `/p/`| `[mp]` | `[hp]` | 
| `/β/`| `[mb]` | `[hp]` |
| `/m/`|        |        | 
| `/t/`| `[nt]` | `[ht]` |
| `/ɾ/`| `[nd]` | *  |
| `/n/`|   *    |    |
| `/s/`|        | `[ss]` |
| `/k/`| `[ŋk]` |    |
| `/ɣ/`| `[ŋɡ]` |    |
| `/ʔ/`|        |    |
| pause| (`∅`)    | (`[ː]`) |

There are two cases to keep in mind:
* While the historical combination of N + `/s/` is in most cases realized as `[ːs]` and is written as such, there are rare instances of it being written as `-ns-` (its phonetic realization might have been `[nts]`).
* While the historical combination of h + `/ɾ/` is in most cases realized as `[ht]` and is written as such, the rule that `/ɾ/` + unaccented short vowel + `/ɾ/` turns the first `/ɾ/` into `[d]` takes precedence and hence is written as `-hd-` (its phonetic realization might have been `[ɦd]`).


## Accent
A syllable can either be accented or unaccented. When accented, `/ə/` becomes `/ɑ/`. Two accented syllables cannot be juxtaposed. Accented syllable also receives either a high pitch (if CV or CVh) or a falling pitch (if CVN or CVː)

## Pause
At the beginning of each line is a pause. After a pause or a nasal, `/β/` is realized as `[b]`, `/ɾ/` is realized as `[d]` and `/ɣ/` is realized as `[ɡ]`. (By the way, `/ɾ/` + unaccented short vowel + `/ɾ/` turns the first `/ɾ/` into `[d]`.)

After a pause, unaccented `/ʔɑN/` and `/ʔɑː/` loses its initial glottal stop except unless an accented syllable immediately follows it. 

## Poetic metre

Each line consists of four metrical feet. Each feet must be quadrimoraic (where CV counts as a single mora and the rest as two), except for the final feet of each line. Lines always come in pairs; thus it is sometimes more convenient to say that a couplet has eight metrical feet.

"Monomoraic + bimoraic + monomoraic" does not constitute a metrical feet.

The following notations will be used:

|          | accented | unaccented |
|----------|----------|------------|
|monomoraic|    `ú`   |    `u`     |
| bimoraic |    `ḿ`   |    `m`     |

### Final feet
A final foot is a foot that ends a line, and therefore is either the fourth or the eighth feet of a couplet.
The eighth feet must either be `ḿ` or `ḿu`. The fourth feet is usually limited to `múu`, `ḿm` or `ḿu`.

### Non-final feet
The seventh feet is exclusively `ḿuu`, `muu` or `úum`. If the seventh feet is `úum`, then the eighth feet must be monosyllabic (i.e. `ḿ`).

`ḿuu`, `muu`, `mm`, and `múu` account for roughly 80% of all the remaining feet. The first three feet of a couplet has a strong tendency to stick to these four (though `mḿ` and `ḿm` are sometimes employed to avoid monotonicity), while the fifth and the sixth feet can make use of a wider variety of quadrimoraic feet, including `ḿuú`, `úuuú`, `úuuu` and `úum`. 

When the fourth feet is `ḿu`, the fifth feet is allowed to be `úmuu` or `úmm`. This extrametric syllable replaces the pause; hence the initial consonant of the following syllable is lenited.
